# Introduction
This contract demonstrates a simple use of dynamic arrays in Solidity by storing and managing a list of integers. The array is initialized in the constructor with preset values 1,2,3,4,5, and because it is declared as public, Solidity automatically generates a getter that allows users to access individual elements. The getArray() function returns the full array in memory, making it easy for external callers to retrieve all stored values at once. This setup helps beginners understand how on-chain arrays behave when exposed through public visibility.

Additionally, the getArrayLength() function returns the total number of elements currently inside the array, demonstrating how Solidity keeps track of dynamic array size automatically. Together, these functions highlight how arrays are initialized, accessed, and read from within a smart contract. Overall, the contract provides a clean example of basic array operations and state management on the Ethereum blockchain.
