# Introduction
This set of contracts demonstrates how Solidity supports inheritance by using a base contract (Shape) that stores a shared property, shapeType, which identifies what kind of shape each child contract represents. The base constructor accepts a string and assigns it internally, while the public getType() function allows users to read the shape’s category. This structure shows how common attributes can be defined once in a parent contract and reused by all child contracts, keeping the code clean and modular.

The Rectangle and Circle contracts both inherit from Shape, passing their specific type to the parent constructor and implementing their own area-calculation functions. Rectangle computes area by multiplying width and height, while Circle uses a simplified formula to keep the example focused on inheritance rather than geometry accuracy. Together, the contracts clearly illustrate how child contracts extend shared logic and add specialized behavior on top. This makes the example a solid introduction to object-oriented patterns and polymorphism in Solidity.
