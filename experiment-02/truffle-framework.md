# Truffle Framework
Truffle is a comprehensive development framework for building, testing, and managing Ethereum-based decentralized applications. It provides a structured project workflow that includes contract compilation, linking, migration, and automated testing using Mocha and Chai. Truffle’s migration system ensures that developers can deploy smart contracts consistently across different networks—local, testnet, or mainnet. It also supports scripting, enabling developers to run deployment tasks, interact with contracts, and automate complex development processes.

### Real-Life Examples:
Large-scale DeFi platforms, such as Uniswap and Compound clones for educational or enterprise setups, often use Truffle during development because it supports automated testing and repeatable deployment. Companies building private blockchain solutions also rely on Truffle to manage multiple contract versions across development and production environments.
