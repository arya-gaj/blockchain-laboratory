# Introduction
This step-by-step sequence explains how to set up and interact with a basic Hyperledger Fabric test network using the official Fabric samples. First, the Fabric binaries and configuration files are downloaded using a single curl command, which automatically fetches all required tools. After navigating into the test_network directory, the command ./network.sh up launches a complete local network with peers, orderers, and certificate authorities running inside Docker containers. This setup provides a ready-made environment for experimenting with channels, chaincode, and Fabric commands without manual configuration.

Once the network is active, users can inspect existing channels by executing peer commands inside the running Docker containers. A new channel—testChannel—is created using createChannel, after which both organizations' peers can verify they are joined to the proper channels. Finally, the entire network can be shut down cleanly using ./network.sh down, which removes containers, clears generated artifacts, and resets the environment. Overall, this workflow makes it easy for newcomers to learn how Fabric networks operate and practice managing channels in a safe, isolated environment.
