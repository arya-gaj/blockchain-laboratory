# Elements of Distributed Computing

Distributed computing refers to the coordinated operation of multiple interconnected computers to achieve a common task. In blockchain, distributed computing allows every node in the network to maintain a copy of the ledger, validate transactions, and participate in consensus mechanisms. This ensures that even if some nodes fail or are compromised, the blockchain continues to operate correctly without any single point of failure. Modern blockchains often use consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) in Bitcoin or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in Ethereum 2.0 to achieve agreement among nodes.

### Real-Life Examples:

The Bitcoin network relies on thousands of nodes worldwide to validate transactions and secure the network without a central authority. Ethereum uses distributed computing to execute smart contracts automatically, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications without intermediaries. Similarly, Filecoin and Storj provide decentralized cloud storage, where files are split and stored across multiple nodes, increasing reliability and data security compared to traditional centralized servers.
