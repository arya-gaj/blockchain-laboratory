# Deployment Environment
Deploying a Solidity contract means sending the compiled bytecode to the Ethereum blockchain. This process requires a wallet, gas fees, and a network—local or public. Several tools make deployment easier. Remix IDE allows browser-based deployment to the JavaScript VM (simulated local blockchain), test networks like Goerli or Sepolia, or even the Ethereum mainnet. Truffle provides a more professional deployment pipeline with migration scripts that automate deployments to local blockchains, testnets, or mainnet. Ganache is commonly used as a local blockchain for testing because it provides instant mining, test accounts, and easy debugging. During deployment, the constructor function (if present) is executed, and the contract is assigned a permanent address on the network. After deployment, users and applications can interact with the contract through its ABI using libraries like Web3.js or Ethers.js.
