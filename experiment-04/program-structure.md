# Program Structure
A typical Solidity program consists of several essential components. At the top, pragma solidity defines the compiler version to ensure compatibility. Contracts are the main building blocks, similar to classes in object-oriented programming. Inside a contract, developers define state variables, functions, events, modifiers, constructors, and fallback functions. State variables store data permanently on the blockchain, while functions contain the core logic and can be marked as public, private, view, pure, or payable. Events allow smart contracts to emit logs that external applications can track, and modifiers are used for conditions like access control. The structure is designed to be modular, readable, and optimized for secure execution within the EVM.
