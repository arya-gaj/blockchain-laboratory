# Introduction
The Variables contract demonstrates the difference between state variables and local variables in Solidity. A state variable, like stateVariable, is permanently stored in the contract’s storage and can be accessed externally because it is declared public. A local variable, such as localVariable inside the fun() function, exists only within the function’s scope and is discarded after execution. Solidity also supports global variables that provide information about the blockchain and transaction properties. When declaring variables, the name must start with an alphabet or underscore, and variable names are case-sensitive, ensuring clarity and avoiding conflicts within the code.

The Operators contract illustrates how Solidity uses various operators for computation and comparison. Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, /, and % allow mathematical calculations, while relational operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) enable comparisons. Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used for boolean logic, bitwise operators (&, |, ^, !, <<, >>) manipulate bits, and assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) update values. Conditional operations, such as if <condition> ? A : B, provide branching logic. The multiply() and compare() functions in the contract showcase these operators in action, helping learners understand how calculations, comparisons, and decision-making are implemented in Solidity smart contracts.
